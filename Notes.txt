-Normal use of proxy by setting it in package.json is not forwarding redirect calls (that have some text prop) so we
 head to add proxy middleware to add more control for our oauth/google api
 (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/#configuring-the-proxy-manually).

-There is also a discussion why is better to use proxy and the answer is that we can then use a cookie to send user info
 and we can escape CORS problem.
